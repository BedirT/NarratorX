Here is a page for proofreading:

```{page}```

Please format it as follows:
- Titles: Recognize and format any section titles as a distinct title entry.
- Paragraphs: Group sentences into `sentence_groups` for each paragraph, maintaining cohesive flow and readability. Correct any typos or unnecessary line breaks.
- End of Page: Determine if the last sentence is complete. Set `is_over` to `True` if it is; otherwise, set `is_over` to `False` and add any unfinished portion to `half_sentence` for continuation on the next page.

Output Fields:
- `section`: Use either `Title`, `Paragraph`, or `IncompleteSentence` to format each part of the page.
    - `Title` is for sections with titles.
    - `Paragraph` contains `sentence_pieces`, a list of sentences grouped cohesively into paragraphs. A sentence can at most be 200 characters long.
    - `IncompleteSentence` stores any partial sentence that should continue on the next page. This could only be the last sentence of the page. Sometimes it is easy to confuse this with a title, the way to differentiate is that the `IncompleteSentence` can only be the last sentence of the page, and the flow of paragraph follows the previous sentence.
- `sentence_groups`: Store each paragraph as a list of sentences in cohesive order to ensure smooth flow for readability. Remember that a sentence can be at most 200 characters long, If a sentence is longer than 200 characters, try to split from a comma or a conjunction (a place where the sentence can be split without breaking the reading flow).
- `half_sentence`: If the last sentence is incomplete, include the unfinished portion here to be continued on the next page.

Guidelines:
- Do not alter the meaning or add content, even if the information appears incorrect.
- Use plain text format only.
